Global Terrorism Attacks - predicting the group responsible

Global Terrorism Database (http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group.

This project uses a model which tries to predict which group may have been responsible for a terrorist incident based on information such as weapons used, attack type and the country of the incident.
